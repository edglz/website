## Project Overview

Fital Wallet is a comprehensive Bitcoin wallet solution that I helped develop, focusing primarily on the backend infrastructure. The project aims to simplify cryptocurrency and NFT management through an intuitive interface and robust backend systems.

Working in collaboration with the frontend team, I implemented critical backend functionalities that power the wallet's core features, including transaction processing, asset management, and third-party integrations.

## Objectives

1. **Streamline Crypto Management**: Create a user-friendly platform for managing Bitcoin and other digital assets.
2. **Secure Transactions**: Implement robust security measures for cryptocurrency transactions.
3. **Seamless Integration**: Develop reliable connections with various crypto services and NFT platforms.

## Features

1. **Transak Integration**: Implemented seamless fiat-to-crypto onboarding using Transak's API.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built a scalable system using event-driven patterns for real-time transaction processing.
3. **WebHook System**: Developed webhook handlers for instant transaction notifications and updates.
4. **NFT Management**: Created endpoints for NFT tracking and management.
5. **Security Features**: Implemented multi-layer security protocols for transaction verification.

## Technology Stack

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com): Powers the backend infrastructure with TypeScript.
- [Transak](https://transak.com): Enables fiat-to-crypto transactions.
- [WebHooks](https://webhook.site): Handles real-time transaction notifications.
- [Event-Driven Architecture]: Manages asynchronous operations and system scalability.
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org): Stores user data and transaction records.

## Challenges & Learning

The development process provided valuable insights into:
- **Cryptocurrency Integration**: Understanding blockchain interactions and crypto transaction flows.
- **Event-Driven Systems**: Implementing robust event handling for real-time operations.
- **Security Implementation**: Ensuring secure transaction processing and data protection.

## Outcome

Fital Wallet has successfully:
- Processed thousands of secure transactions
- Integrated multiple cryptocurrency services
- Maintained 99.9% uptime for critical operations
- Achieved sub-second transaction notification times

## Future Plans

The roadmap includes:
- Expanding supported cryptocurrencies and tokens
- Implementing advanced security features
- Enhancing real-time transaction monitoring
- Adding more third-party integrations for improved functionality
